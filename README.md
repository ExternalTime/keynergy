# keynergy
This is the core library of the Keynergy project. It includes functionality for loading, modifying, and analyzing layouts. 

It is used as the basis for [KLCord](https://github.com/keynergy/klcord), [layoutexport](https://github.com/keynergy/layoutexport), 
as well as CLI and GUI analysis applications that are in development.

## Usage

It's not recommended to use this library yet, as it has not reached release 1.0.0. 
Because of this, there will be frequent breaking changes in order for development to be as fast as possible.
1.0.0 probably won't be released until the official CLI application is released.

## Contributing
This library is a small project, but the code is likely not written very idiomatically. 
If you're at all experienced with Rust, feel free to look around at the code and change anything you think could be improved.
Any contributions are appreciated - even documentation additions or comments are extremely helpful.
